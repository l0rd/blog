## Abstract

[GitHub Codespaces](https://github.com/features/codespaces) is a new VS Code based project that GitHub is currently rolling out as a limited beta and will then become a commercial product.

The client side of a codespace runs in the browser and the server side in a container and thatâ€™s how a Che workspace works too! Developers start a codespace clicking on a button of a GitHub repository and Che workspaces are started with a single click on a web link too!

Codespaces and Che may, at first glance, look like two applications that solve the same problem. But after a closer look their design and use case differ deeply as we will discuss in the webinar.
