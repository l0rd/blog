## Abstract

What if your IDE could run in a container? And what if it could be scheduled and scaled with a container orchestrator as Kubernetes? You could share the same repeatable dev environment with all your team. You could run it in the cloud and scale it as needed. Unfortunately that’s not something that can be done with any Java IDE. The IDE should have been designed from the ground up to run in the cloud. Luckily such an IDE exists, it’s an Open Source Eclipse project and it’s name is Che. In this talk we are going to have a look at Che, the benefits of running an IDE in the cloud and the work we have achieved to make Che, a web app written in Java, running on Kubernetes.
