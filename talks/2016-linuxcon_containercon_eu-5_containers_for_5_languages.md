## Abstract

Go, Rust, Swift, Haskell and JavaScript are among the hottest languages in 2016 and all have different features that will be exploited to show different patterns to build, test and run applications using containers.

Building upon an earlier workshop at BreizhCamp in 2015 (https://gist.github.com/l0rd/316164ad3f170cde9b12, http://l0rd.github.io/talks/containers-and-languages/), attendees will be lead through the development of samples applications written in different languages in order to illustrate different containers usage patterns.

After a short description of the language, the container and the pattern to use participants will be asked to put into practice these patterns using a sample project.
