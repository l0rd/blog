## Abstract

Eclipse Che provides a web-based integrated development environment (IDE) and cloud workspace that runs in a Linux container. Workspaces in Eclipse Che are bundled with an appropriate runtime stack, provided by containers too, which contains everything needed to code, build, test, and run a project. These workspaces run in the cloud, making it easier to share developer environments with your team.

Earlier this year, we adapted Eclipse Che to run in the cloud using Red Hat OpenShift. That was part of the effort to build https://openshift.io, a new cloud development platform by Red Hat.

In this session, we are going to walk through the advantages of running an IDE in a container and in a Kubernetes and Red Hat OpenShift cluster. We are also going to talk about how we have modified Eclipse Che, a two-tier Java application, to make it ready for Red Hat OpenShift.
